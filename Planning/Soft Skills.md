Soft skills is really necessary for me. I am good at certain points but I am ignorant to my presentation skills and other areas that I lack. I have to work on them constantly to improve.

# It includes :

- My profile on other professional platforms including linkedin and twitter.
- My *way of speaking* while being professional and *casual* both !
- Learning *time management* and *priorities*.


##### Time Management :

~ Flexibility doesn't mean that you shouldn't put restricitions. Flexibility means, you should be able to put your free slots of time in use when another priority comes up. 
~ To the things of high priority, time shouldn't be compromised at all. You should atleast spend the amount of time you assigned for them.
