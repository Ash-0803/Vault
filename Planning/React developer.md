###### ~ This year, I will not be focusing on DSA. Rather I'll do open source and focus on web-development. 
###### ~ I'll assess my position at the end of the year in programming and then take the steps ahead accordingly.
###### ~ For now, mastering web development is my goal for the year.

# Plan :
- Study react for *4 hours everyday* until you've made **3 projects** atleast.
- *After* making the **1st project**, learn *tailwind CSS* and make other 2 projects using it.
-
